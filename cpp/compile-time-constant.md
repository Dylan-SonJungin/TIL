# Compile Time Constant



**Compile-time refers to when the code is being compiled (converted from human-readable code -> machine code),** 
**not when the program is running.**

<br/>

A `compile-time constant` is a value that is known and fixed *during the compilation process*

- there is no extra computation or lookup happening while your program runs
- the values are directly inserted into the compiled code, just like hard-coded numbers
